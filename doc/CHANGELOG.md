# Changelog

Dated entries, newest first. Appended to, never rewritten. What belongs here is
what changed and why it had to; the reasoning behind a choice that could have
gone another way belongs in DECISIONS.md, and every threshold belongs in
CRITERIA.md.

### The bulk real-time endpoint lags a session, and nothing noticed

The first fully scheduled live morning ran clean, exit zero at every step, and
published a report describing the previous session.

`/real-time/{any}.US` returns the last COMPLETED session. At 08:45 ET on a
trading day the last completed session is yesterday, so the endpoint's `close`
is yesterday's close and its `previousClose` is the close before that. The
scan read the first as this morning's premarket price and the second as the
prior session close. Confirmed against EODHD's own end of day history for all
twelve candidates: twelve of twelve `prior_close` values equalled the 08-12
close, and eleven of twelve `price` values equalled the 08-13 close to the
cent.

Four fields were corrupted by that one read:

- `price`, which was the prior session's close rather than a premarket print.
- `prior_close`, which was the close of the session before that.
- `gap_pct`, computed between those two, which was therefore the prior
  session's own move. ARX was published at "gap +43.35 percent" when its real
  premarket gap that morning was +0.38 percent, and WDAY at +17.78 percent
  when its real gap was +0.14 percent.
- `pm_rvol`, whose numerator was the delayed quote's `ethVolume`. That field
  describes the previous extended session until the vendor rolls it, measured
  on this date as after 08:45 and before 08:56. At 08:45 it gave ARX
  20,744,130 shares of yesterday's post market.

`prior_high` was the only one of the group that was right, read from end of day
history and correctly dated to the prior session. That is what made the failure
visible: `price` and `prior_high` were both from 2026-08-13, so the
`require_above_prior_high` gate compared a session's close against its own
high, which can never pass. Both watchlists were structurally guaranteed empty,
and the report explained it as a dull tape.

Fixed by sourcing every published price from the collector, which is the only
feed on this plan carrying today's premarket, and by reading `prior_close` and
`prior_high` out of the same end of day record so they cannot drift apart
again. The bulk endpoint is kept for membership only, where ranking 2,745 names
in one call is a thing nothing else can do, and every field it produces is
named `selection_*` and overwritten before scoring. See DECISIONS.md.

### A vintage assertion that ends the run

Nothing in the pipeline had ever asked whether the data was from today, so
nothing objected. `src/vintage.py` now asks, after pricing and before scoring,
and a violation ends the run: the gate marker is rewritten naming every failing
row and scan exits non-zero, which stops the morning chain before the analyst
call. There is no degrade path, because a stale price is not thin evidence to
hedge around.

Four checks. (a) every priced candidate's price timestamp falls inside today's
premarket window. (b) `prior_high` is not below `prior_close`, since a session's
high cannot be below its own close. (c) the prior close is dated to the prior
trading session per the exchange calendar, not merely to some earlier date.
(d) the market snapshot is from today, where a row explicitly labelled
`prior_session_only` is held instead to being correctly dated to the prior
session.

Check (b) alone would have caught this morning without a single vendor call:
six of the twelve candidates carried a `prior_high` below their own
`prior_close`. Replaying that packet through the check now fires (a), (b) and
(d), leaves (c) silent because that field was in fact correct, and names all
six impossible rows in the marker file. `src/test_vintage.py`.

### A floor under the RVOL denominator

`usable_for_rvol` accepted any baseline with enough sessions and a median above
zero. ARX's premarket median was 23.5 shares and MH's was 10, so the ratio
built on them was arithmetic without meaning: ARX scored an RVOL of 882,728 and
maxed the RVOL scoring band by construction. Six of the twelve candidates sat
below the new floor.

`min_baseline_premarket_volume = 1000` shares, in CRITERIA.md under Baseline
next to its sibling `min_sessions_for_rvol`, which is the threshold it works
with and the function that reads it. A seed value chosen to exclude degenerate
denominators, not a validated threshold. Below it, `pm_rvol` is null with the
reason recorded and the RVOL component is unavailable, which routes through the
existing `score_partial` and `score_unavailable` machinery from 2758972 rather
than a second path: the total goes null, the conviction bucket goes null, and
the report says unscored.

A floor on the denominator, not a cap on the ratio. A cap would have turned
882,728 into a plausible looking number and hidden the fact that the
denominator was never usable.

### Containment went dark exactly when it mattered

`claims_checked` was 0 and `columns_scanned` was 0. Both screens were empty, so
the model omitted both watchlist tables entirely, and the tables are where the
guard finds the `Ticker` header it locates claims by. Meanwhile the report
named twelve tickers in bold prose, none of them validated. The check reported
a clean pass over a report it had not read.

Two changes, folded into the existing containment path rather than a second
one. REPORT_TEMPLATE.md and prompt rule 12 now require both tables to be
written even when empty, header and separator and a single `| none | | | |`
row, and the deterministic fallback report does the same. And containment now
extracts ticker shaped tokens from prose as well as table columns: a report
with prose ticker claims and no ticker column at all is a structural failure,
returning 2, not a pass with a footnote.

Prose is ambiguous where a Ticker column is not, so time expressions and ISO
dates are stripped before tokens are taken (`06:37 ET` is a time, and ET is
also Energy Transfer) and a stopword list in CRITERIA.md removes what survives.
That list contains some real tickers and is a recorded fail-open; see the prose
stopword note there.

### Also

- Candidates the collector never subscribed to are dropped rather than priced,
  named in the packet's new `dropped_no_coverage` list with a reason, and
  counted in the run summary. See DECISIONS.md.
- `packet.json` carries `build`, the resolved commit and a dirty flag, so a
  report can be tied to the code that wrote it.
- A null `gap_pct` no longer reads as a checked zero in the eligibility test,
  which would have produced "gap_pct 0.00 fails > 3", a claim about the stock
  made out of a fact about the pipeline.
- The gate table in verify_morning.py now shows the price and the minute it
  printed, alongside the collector premarket volume that feeds RVOL. The
  failure that made the gate earn its keep was invisible without a clock beside
  the price.

### Packet schema

New keys: `build`, `vintage`, `dropped_no_coverage`. New candidate fields:
`price_time`, `price_source`, `pm_volume`, `prior_close`, `prior_source`,
`gap_reason`, `pm_rvol_basis`, and the `selection_*` group replacing the
candidate `price`, `prior_close` and `gap_pct` that the bulk feed used to
write directly. New market snapshot fields: `as_of` on every row,
`prior_session_only`, `prior_session_date`.

There is no SCHEMA.md in this repository to record that in. Noted here instead.
